Brief description:
Calculates a solution for the unblockme mobile game (see https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/unblock-me-free/id315019111?mt=8) by building up a graph that contains the adjacency relations between states, and then finds the shortest path from the initial state to the solution state using the Boost graph library.

Requirements:
Main program compiled on Visual Studio 2015, although most dependencies exist in earlier version of Visual Studio as well.
Visualisation is done using Mathematica (see Documentation/unblockme.nb or its pdf version), which serves to provide the input (Documentation/problemdef.dat) and visualise the output (Documentation/unblockme_solution.gif) of the main program.

Results:
Check out the Documentation folder - the unblockme_solution.gif provides an animated gif visualizing the result.
